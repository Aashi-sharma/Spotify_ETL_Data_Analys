In the "Spotify ETL Data Analysis" project, we aim to explore and derive insights from the vast music dataset provided by Spotify. The project involves an Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process, where we extract relevant data from Spotify's dataset, transform it to make it suitable for analysis, and load it into a structured format for exploration.

The project focuses on key aspects such as top tracks, artists, and various audio features, including danceability, energy, liveness, acousticness, and tempo. Through this analysis, we aim to answer questions about user preferences, trends in music, and characteristics of popular tracks and artists.

The ETL process involves cleaning and shaping the data, aggregating relevant information, and creating a structured dataset for analysis. Visualization tools such as Matplotlib and Seaborn are utilized to create insightful graphs and charts, providing a visual representation of the trends observed in the Spotify dataset.

Ultimately, the "Spotify ETL Data Analysis" project aims to offer a comprehensive understanding of Spotify's music landscape, providing valuable insights for music enthusiasts, industry professionals, and anyone interested in the patterns and characteristics of the music available on the platform.
